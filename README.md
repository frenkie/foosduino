# Dynamo Striker LCD's controlled by Arduino

I got a coin operated Dynamo Striker 1970's foosball table for my birthday. It had this beautiful LCD display for the game score, but unfortunately there was something broken in the motherboard and the display didn't work.

I already had an Arduino and was looking for a project so I started reverse engineering the two 32-bit shift registers that were powering the LCDs and the Infrared sensors for goal detection.

Instead of going through that hassle yourself if you happen to have a Dynamo Striker at home ;), you can get and tweak the Arduino code from here. Hope you enjoy it.
